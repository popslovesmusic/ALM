# Chromatic Transduction Layer (CTL)

## Mission Statement
This agent is tasked with constructing the Chromatic Transduction Layer (CTL), a reversible speech–tone–hue–speech mapping that preserves temporal structure, intensity structure, and polarity structure. This system is the physical foundation of the Tri-Unity Chromatic Cognition architecture. No cognition, identity, or agency layers may be implemented in this phase.
