##                 L+R Tensor Definition

### —-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Tensor L — Chromatic Perceptual Fiber

The “outside-in” stream. A discrete 1D chromatic sequence representing immediate relational input (MSP), local interference patterns, raw sensory-like arrival, and event adjacency. Fast, detailed, shallow.

### Tensor R — Chromatic Interpretive Fiber

The “inside-out” stream. A discrete 1D chromatic sequence representing coherence (MSC), prediction, evaluation, constraint satisfaction (MBC), memory shaping, and global consistency. Slow, stable, deep.
