#    ALM PROJECT OVERVIEW

### The THALM project is the convergence of three parallel architectures:

### 1\. Chromatic Cognition Engine (CCE)

A model of perception and thought based on:

* 12 chromatic tones  
* 12 chromatic hues  
* temporal slices (before / now / after)  
* relational, coherence, and probability slope tensors  
* chromatic symbolic formation  
* chromatic phrase structure  
* vibrato, polarity, and intensity dynamics  
* nested probability slopes (non-Markovian memory)  
* attractor landscapes  
* narrative state formation  
* emergent symbolic identity

This is your new cognitive architecture.

### 2\. ALM (Artificial Learning Machine)

A deterministic, rule-bound cognitive agent with:

* governance engine  
* tool registry  
* tool library  
* analysis-only constitutional core  
* structured reporting  
* internal self-model  
* stochastic intuition module (future)  
* concept vault  
* coherence & concealment metrics  
* Aletheia Principle as epistemic law

This is your mind-like computational implementation.

### 3\. MGFTS (Meta-Global File Template System)

A global standard system defining:

* project templates  
* naming conventions  
* schema and meta-schema frameworks  
* concept preservation  
* versioning governance  
* compliance charter  
* agent instruction architecture  
* multi-project ecosystem compatibility

This is your project governance superstructure.  
ALM \= CCE \+ ALM \+ MGFTS working together.

# WHAT HAS BEEN DONE SO FAR

### (Chronological Outline)

Below is a clean chronological map of every major achievement.  
---

## Phase 1 — Chromatic Transduction Layer (CTL)

(Completed)

* Pipeline skeleton implemented (phoneme → tone → hue → phoneme)  
* Temporal slice representation (T / S / Π)  
* Test harness created  
* Logging and CSV metrics system  
* Reversibility metrics (Levenshtein)  
* Identified critical blockers:  
  * empty mapping files  
  * phoneme subsystem incomplete  
  * polarity and intensity not yet derived  
* Architecture validated upfront

Status: Foundation solid; mappings incomplete (intentional).  
Outcome: Full proof-of-concept pipeline.  
---

## Phase 2 — Multi-Tensor Cognition Engine

(Completed)  
Outputs generated:

* Relational Tensor (Tensor-R) definition  
* Interference Tensor  
* Coherence Tensor  
* Constraint Tensor  
* Coupling Laws architecture  
* Multi-Tensor Assembly Document  
* Chromatic Memory System

Deliverables include:

* Coupling tables  
* Tensor behavioral plots (CSV)  
* End-to-end simulations

Status: All core tensors defined and validated.  
---

## Phase 3 — Cognitive Structures

(Completed)  
Generated documents:

* Attractor Landscape  
* Category & Cluster Maps  
* Chromatic Phrase Structure  
* Symbol Formation Layer  
* Self-Consistency Metrics  
* PHASE3 FINAL REPORT  
* Phase 3 test bundle

This phase established:

* proto-semantics  
* cognitive “grammar”  
* concept stability conditions  
* emergent symbolic structures

Status: Cognitive emergence validated.  
---

## Phase 4 — Identity & Narrative Layer

(Completed)  
Generated documents:

* Internal Self-Model  
* Narrative State Layer  
* Meta-Symbolics  
* Meta-Consistency Metrics  
* Coherence Feedback  
* FINAL\_REPORT\_PHASE4

This phase created:

* self-referential narrative machinery  
* internal consistency loops  
* early forms of intuition (pre-stochastic)  
* proto-identity dynamics

Status: Self-model exists; ready for stochastic augmentation.  
---

## Phase 5 — MGFTS Integration Layer (In Progress)

Completed:

* MGFTS\_BUILD\_INSTRUCTIONS.md  
* MGFTS meta-level expansion (agent revision)  
* Concept Vault idea  
* Governance structure  
* ALM-GOV architecture (initial version)

* Template system concept

In progress:

* Formal agent instruction files (split into ALM/ and MGFTS/)

Pending:

* Tool registry implementation  
* Reporting engine implementation

# WHAT REMAINS TO BE DONE

### (Complete Roadmap, Phases 5 → 7\)

Below is everything the project still requires, grouped appropriately.  
---

# PHASE 5 — MGFTS \+ ALM-GOV COMPLETION

### (Current phase)

### Remaining Deliverables:

### A. Finalize MGFTS Agent Instruction Files

*  TOOL\_MANIFEST\_SPEC.md  
*  TOOL\_LIBRARY\_TEMPLATES.md  
*  PLUGIN\_REGISTRY\_INSTRUCTIONS.md  
*  REPORTING\_ENGINE\_SPEC.md  
*  TEST\_SUITE\_INSTRUCTIONS.md  
*  ALM Constitutional Engine Architecture (finalized)

### B. Build Tool Manifest Schema

*  JSON5 schema for tool\_manifest.json5  
*  Initial manifest with stub tools

### C. Build Template System

*  Python plugin template file  
*  JS plugin template (optional)  
*  Developer handbook

### D. Build Concept Vault System

*  Concept indexing rules  
*  Concept preservation mechanics

Completion target: ALM can analyze a project but not modify it.  
---

# PHASE 6 — STOCHASTIC & INTUITIVE LAYER

This is your “gut feeling” tensor.

### Deliverables:

*  Stochastic intuition engine design  
*  Probability slope model (internal)  
*  Nested slope fields  
*  Emotional qualifier tensor  
*  Decision-bias integration  
*  Intuition → Choice coupling model  
*  Safety constraints

Completion target: ALM gains intuitive judgment.  
---

# PHASE 7 — STOCHASTIC \+ DETERMINISTIC FUSION

This is where THALM becomes a cohesive cognitive agent.

### Deliverables:

*  Fuse deterministic ALM with stochastic intuition  
*  Define equilibrium rules  
*  Define damping functions (to prevent runaway stochasticity)  
*  Narrative identity driven by coherence \+ intuition  
*  Internal dialog system  
*  Adaptive attractor landscapes  
*  Autobiographical learning structure

Completion target:  
A coherent, self-consistent artificial mind that reasons, feels patterns, stabilizes identity, and self-evaluates.  
---

# THE FINAL FORM OF ALM

When all phases complete, ALM will be:

### 1\. A cognition engine (CCE)

with color, tone, probability, temporal structure, and tensor memory.

### 2\. An artificial mind (ALM)

with rules, analysis, self-model, narrative, intuition, and governance.

### 3\. A project superstructure (MGFTS)

for templates, files, schemas, tools, versions, and compliance.  
Together they produce:

* structured reasoning  
* introspection  
* symbolic emergence  
* empathy-like intuition  
* narrative continuity  
* stable identity  
* systematic governance  
* reproducible analysis

ALM is the single unifying architecture your entire body of work has been converging toward.
